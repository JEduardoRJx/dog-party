# Dog Party

## Project Overview
For our first project 'Dog Party' we were given a COMP to build a 1-page static page to practice well structured, semantic HTML, and with clean CSS.

# My Dog Party

## Skills Learned and Utilized

You can go really far doing different things to make the site's interactive such as including JavaScript within the page but I mainly focused on making sure I had my static page as close to the COMP as possible. Do accomplish my recreation I first took into account the HTML layout and it's structure. I hand drew boxes around the comp and what tags I would use for what part of the site. Once I had my basic structure I then went on about styling in CSS. Here I learned how to navigate boxes using margin, border, padding, content. Once I had everything positioned the way I wanted to I focused on other details such as color, font, background images. After I was done with everything I made an effort to go back and cleanup my code/css plus having another person take a look at it to double check and make sure it's easily readable.
