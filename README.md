#Dog Party

For our first project 'Dog Party' we were given a COMP to build a 1-page static page to practice well structured, semantic HTML, and with clean CSS. You can go really far as to include JavaScript interaction with the page but I focused mainly on making sure I had my static page as close to the COMP as possible.

*Static COMP page given to us to recreate:*
